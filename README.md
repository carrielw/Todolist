### Features
Tasks are saved until you close the app (they reset when the server restarts).

Clean and simple design.

Works on any device with a web browser.

### How to Run the App
Make sure you have Python installed.
Install Flask (if you don't have it):
pip install flask
Run the app:

python app.py
Open your web browser and go to:

http://[your-computer-ip]:5000 (for others on the same WiFi network)

### Notes
This is a simple demo app - tasks aren't saved permanently.
Only people on your same WiFi network can access it when you run it with 0.0.0.0.
